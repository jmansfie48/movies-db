## Agile Board
An Agile Board for this exercise is available on Trello at https://trello.com/b/0HEmhdya/agile-board.

## Tech Stack
### Back End
I am using Node.js + Express (https://expressjs.com/). This is a well-known, lightweight framework for building web applications. 

### Authentication
I am using the Auth0 authentication via the Auth0 SDK (https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs). Auth0 is a well-recognized authentication service that integrates easily with other parts of the application.

### Database
Local JSON storage; I just wanted to get things working and would replace with something more conventional

### Front End
HTML page built on the KnockoutJS framework (https://knockoutjs.com/); I chose this MVVM framework mostly out of familiarity.
