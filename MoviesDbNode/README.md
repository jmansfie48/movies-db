## Agile Board
An Agile Board for this exercise is available on Trello at https://trello.com/b/0HEmhdya/agile-board.

## Demo
Visit http://ec2-54-165-167-218.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/ to see the application in action.

## Tech Stack

### Cloud Hosting
The app is deployed on AWS EC2. I followed guidance provided at https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/977/how-to-deploy-a-node-js-application-on-aws-ec2-server.

### Back End
I am using Node.js + Express (https://expressjs.com/). This is a well-known, lightweight framework for building web applications. 

### Authentication
I am using Auth0 authentication via the Auth0 SDK (https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs). 
Auth0 is a well-recognized authentication service with easy-to-implement access control, and it integrates easily with other parts of the application.

### Database
Local JSON storage; I just wanted to get things working and would like to replace it with something more conventional if time permits.

### Front End
HTML page built using the Pug template engine for Node.js + Express (https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html).
Simple implementation that afforded me the functionality I needed.
